**Update 3/10/2025**
- Added a check to prevent AI-controlled vehicles from halting if the modder specifically makes them never halt in combat (example: T-34 for the soviet style assault), this will allow for more historically accurate gameplay even though the ai driver will sometime still halt to aim then fire but I think it's good enough. 

**Update 3/9/2025**
- Tweaked the combat reverse to prevent AI on vehicle getting stuck, mostly reducing the duration of cooldown halting
- Increase the slope detection angle from 15 degrees to 20 degrees.

**Update 3/8/2025**
- Added the projectile leading system to all vehicle ai firing behaviour except the wire-guided missile (TOW) weapon type.
- Added avoidance path check so ai vehicle won't do combat reverse while near another vehicle to prevent them from getting stuck. 
- Added a 20s timer to missile boat target tracking before dropping.
- Fixed AI not getting into boats and vehicles in water under certain conditions.
- Implemented a new prediction system for turret and non-driver gunner AI actors.
- Introduced a new wire-guided missile system for AI in boats, ensuring they never drop their target and always aim at the ground their enemy is standing on. This improves SOFA's missile boat AI behavior.

**Update 3/7/2025**
- Added more instances of vehicle anti-stuck reverse to prevent issues caused by the new reverse system.
- Reverted idle behavior changes.
- Implemented an idle animation check to prevent soft locks when AI is entering a vehicle (e.g., SOFA's Archipelago map).
- Adjusted AI behavior so that bots only run away from vehicles if their velocity is over 4f, reducing the distance and frequency of their fleeing behavior.

**Update 3/6/2025**
- Temporarily removed AI melee, grenade, and subweapon switching to fix issues preventing AI from firing after exiting water.
- Adjusted aim fire timing to improve vehicle accuracy at long range (e.g., tanks).
- Fixed an issue where vehicle drivers without passengers would stop driving.
- Added additional checks:
  - Preventing the game from falsely detecting a vehicle as stuck after reversing.
  - Implemented new AI behavior: When reloading under fire, AI will reverse until either the enemy stops firing or the weapon is fully reloaded.
- Re-added grenade launcher and melee switching to ensure system integrity.

**Update 3/5/2025**
- Removed ragdolling again.
- Removed melee and subweapon switching for AI.
- Reintroduced vehicle falling/ragdolling but clamped velocity at 15.
- Disabled high-speed ragdolling.
